One way to avoid the issues with `calc()` is to avoid mixing percentage and fixed units. Instead, consider using only percentage or fixed units for the width.  If you absolutely need to calculate a width based on a combination of percentages and pixels,  consider using a JavaScript solution or a CSS preprocessor that can handle these calculations more reliably.  For instance, a JavaScript solution could dynamically calculate the width based on the available space and adjust the element accordingly.  As a last resort, fallback to using media queries to target specific viewport sizes and set the width accordingly.
